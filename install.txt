---                           REQUIREMENTS:                               ---

PHP 4.3.x or later	 www.php.net
XMail server 1.21 or later www.xmailserver.org

                              - - - - - - -

You must have an Xmail server that is correctly running and the host server 
must have the port 6017 free for Xmail remote control access (if your system
just use this port, read the 'readme' file coming with Xmail documentation 
to learn how to change that port). 
Be sure NOT TO BE an 'Open relay' for the spammers:

	- the SERVER.TAB file of Xmail server contain the setting variable 
	  "EnableAuthSMTP-POP3": it must be uncommented and set to "1";
	
	- the SMTPRELAY.TAB file of Xmail server must not contain the line
	  "0.0.0.0"<tab>"0.0.0.0"
	  
                              - - - - - - -

================================
CLEAN INSTALL:
Install of the PHPXmail web interface is very simple: in the almost all of
the cases you just need to unzip to htdocs and browse to it, then you should 
enter the server setting; you are so ready to add domains, users, mailing 
lists... and experience with your Xmail server.

We suggest, however, to read carefully all the parts of this document 
(including the troubleshooting section).

To get the maximum from PHPXmail the suggestions are:
- start Xmail server with all the 'log options' enabled: you may enable them
  from the command line that start Xmail server (see 'readme' file at the
  relative section).
  
- insert a true local network IP address in the server settings of PHPXmail
  (the local host value 127.0.0.1 is deprecated: use it only if you experience
  troubles with your system or if you are directly connected to the internet
  and do not have a local network).

- immediatly define the 'user defaults' in 'server config' menu and define 
  'IP maps' security access policies before to create a domain and to add 
  users.
  
                              - - - - - - -

================================
UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:
Delete all files but SERVERS.PHP under the root directory of PHPXmail, then
unzip the package to the same directory and browse to it: you are just ready
to continue your experience with your Xmail server.

--- PHP Xmail
Consult the official support forum of PHPXmail at the PHPXmail section of
  http://www.nextcode.org/forums

General issues:
  CANNOT LOGIN  (due to an initial wrong server info settings): 
  - close the browser
  - delete the server.php file under the root directory of PHPXmail
  - reopen the browser on the main PHPXmail page adding the correct server
    settings.


================================
--- PHP 
PHP.INI must contain:
session.use_cookies=yes


================================
--- Xmail
in the CTRLACCOUNTS.TAB do not use an e-mail address for PHPXmail access: use
instead something like 'rootadmin ' or so on (DO NOT USE the @ symbol inside).
